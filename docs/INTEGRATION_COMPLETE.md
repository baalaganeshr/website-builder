- **💰 Zero API costs**: Use your own hardware instead of cloud services
- **🌐 Offline capable**: No internet required for code generation
- **⚡ Your speed**: Performance depends on your local hardware

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Setup (One-time)
```powershell
# Run the setup script
./setup.ps1
```

### 2. Start Ollama (Every time)
```bash
# Make sure your GPT-20B is running
ollama serve

# Verify it's available
ollama list
```

### 3. Launch the Application
```powershell
# Double-click or run:
./start.bat
```

### 4. Use Your Website Builder
1. Open **http://localhost:5173**
2. Upload a screenshot or mockup
3. Select **"GPT-20B (Local)"** from the model dropdown
4. Choose your output format (React, Vue, HTML, etc.)
5. Click **Generate** and watch your local AI create code!

## 🛠 Technical Details

### Architecture
```
Frontend (React + Vite)  ←→  Backend (FastAPI)  ←→  Ollama Server
     :5173                      :7001                :11434
                                                  (Your GPT-20B)
```

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `backend/models/ollama_client.py` - Ollama integration
- `backend/llm.py` - Added Ollama model definitions  
- `backend/routes/generate_code.py` - Added local model routing
- `backend/config.py` - Ollama configuration
- `backend/.env` - Environment variables
- `frontend/.env.local` - Frontend configuration

### Configuration
Your `backend/.env` is configured for:
```env
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME=gpt-20b
```

## 🎨 Usage Examples

### Converting Screenshots to Code
1. **Upload**: Drag any website screenshot into the interface
2. **Configure**: 
   - Output: React + Tailwind CSS
   - Model: GPT-20B (Local)
   - Quality: High
3. **Generate**: Your local AI will stream the code generation live
4. **Edit**: Use the built-in editor to refine the output
5. **Export**: Download as complete project or copy code

### Benefits Over Cloud Solutions
- **Privacy**: Screenshots of proprietary designs stay local
- **Cost**: No per-request charges or monthly subscriptions  
- **Speed**: Direct local inference (depending on your hardware)
- **Customization**: Full control over model parameters
- **Reliability**: No network dependencies or rate limits

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Cannot connect to Ollama server"**
- Solution: Run `ollama serve` in a terminal
- Check: Ollama is listening on port 11434

**"Model not found: gpt-20b"**
- Solution: Run `ollama list` to see available models
- Update `OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME` in `backend/.env` if different

**"Backend won't start"**
- Solution: Check Poetry is installed (`poetry --version`)
- Run: `cd backend && poetry install`

**"Frontend won't start"**  
- Solution: Install dependencies (`cd frontend && yarn install`)
- Check: Node.js is installed (`node --version`)
